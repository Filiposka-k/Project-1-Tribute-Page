        <p class="book">"According to the book,she and her husband, Sayyed Bozorg “Moody” Mahmoody, and their daughter, Mahtob
            Mahmoody, traveled to Iran in
            August 1984 for what her husband said would be a two-week visit with his family in Tehran. Once the two
            weeks were over, however, he refused to allow his wife and child to leave. When she protested, Moody struck
            Betty. It was the first time Mahtob had seen her father hit her mother. After Moody broke the news to Betty,
            she got extremely sick with dysentery. Mahtob sat at her side day after day, watching her fade in and out of
            consciousness. Betty asked Mahtob to make sure Moody, a medical doctor, didn't give her an injection as she
            feared it may have been lethal. Mahtob sat there and made sure her mother was safe. Betty was trapped in a
            nation hostile to Americans, with in-laws who were hostile to her, and an abusive husband. According to the
            book, her husband separated her from her daughter for weeks on end. He also assaulted her and threatened to
            kill her if she tried to leave.

            She eventually escaped with her daughter. The book details her 500 mi (800 km) escape over the snowy Zagros
            Mountains into Turkey, and the help she received from many Iranians. After returning to the USA in
            1986, she filed for divorce."</p>
